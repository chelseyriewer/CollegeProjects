		Campaign Trail Ruleset <br>

Players:  2-4 <br>

Pre-Game Setup:  Each player enters their name and chooses a home state.  Certain advantages will be conferred to each player in their home state.  Each player also starts the game in their home state. <br>

Turn Order:  First Turn is chosen Randomly and play proceeds clockwise from there. <br>

Resources:  Each player starts the game with 500 Donations and advertising level of 1 in every state.  Each player starts with 0/100 influence in every state except their home state which starts with 35/100 influence.<br>

Turns Proceed as Follows: <br>
1)	Movement <br>
	a.	Player selects which state to move to – moving farther costs more donations. <br>
	b.	Each state they must pass through adds $100 to the cost. <br>
	c.	Players may remain in the state they are in for free. <br>
2)	Card Drawing (Campaign Event) <br>
	a.	Player draws a Campaign Event card and follows its instructions. <br>
3)	Collect Donations <br>
	a.	For each advertising level a player has in a state, they earn $100 in donations. <br>
4)	Advertising  <br>
	a.	Players may spend donations to increase their advertising level in the state they are in. <br>
		i.	Newspaper advertising increases advertising level by 1 for a cost of $100 <br>
		ii.	Radio advertising increasing advertising level by 3 for a cost of $200 <br>
		iii.	Television advertising increases advertising level by 6 for a cost of $300 <br>
		iv.	Players may only buy one of each advertising type per turn <br>
5)	Delegate Locking <br>
	a.	Players may spend $1000 to lock in their control of the state they are in as long as they have surpassed the influence requirement in that state. <br>
6)	End <br>
	a.	Player will press the button that says “End Turn”. <br>

After all players have taken their turn in a round, influence will be updated for that round.  Influence is updated as follows:  New = Old + Advertising Level <br>

Win Conditions: <br>
Whichever player has the most delegates when all 50 states are “locked” will win the game.  Should a player lock in a majority of delegates before then, the game will end and that player wins. <br>
